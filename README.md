# On-Orbit Satellite Collision Predictor

A mission-control style platform for **space situational awareness (SSA)**: conjunction analysis, collision risk scoring, ML-assisted prediction, and 3D orbital visualization.

This project is designed to evolve from portfolio demo to production-grade engineering system with strict contracts, typed boundaries, CI/CD discipline, and operational reliability.

**Repository:** `DevDonzo/aegis-orbit`  
**Primary branch:** `main`

---

## System overview

### Core components

- **Backend (`backend/`)** — FastAPI service for satellite snapshots, conjunction detection, and prediction APIs.
- **Frontend (`frontend/`)** — Next.js 14 dashboard with Cesium globe, telemetry overlays, alerts, and operational status panels.
- **ML pipeline (`backend/ml/`)** — Optional trained model path with heuristic fallback for resilient prediction behavior.

### Runtime flow

1. Backend computes a dashboard snapshot from orbital samples and exposes API endpoints.
2. Frontend polls `/dashboard` (with `/satellites` + `/collisions` fallback), then merges into Zustand state.
3. Cesium scene renders tracks, vectors, and risk data from normalized frontend types.
4. Prediction/status overlays read `/predict` and `/ml/status`; WebSocket status can supplement polling.

## Local development

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Backend defaults:

- API base: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Auth toggle: `SAT_AUTH_REQUIRED` (default `false`)

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend defaults:

- App URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend URL source: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL`
- Cesium assets copied via `postinstall` and `npm run build`

---

## Configuration

### Frontend environment variables

Create `frontend/.env.local` (or copy `frontend/.env.example`):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_GLOBE_IMAGERY_MODE=cesium-ion
NEXT_PUBLIC_ARCGIS_TOKEN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CESIUM_ION_TOKEN=
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_GLOBE_IMAGERY_MODE`:

- `cesium-ion` (highest quality when Ion token is present)
- `arcgis`
- `osm`

### Backend environment variables (selected)

- `SAT_ENVIRONMENT` (`development|staging|production`)
- `SAT_AUTH_REQUIRED` (`true|false`)
- `SAT_JWT_SECRET` (required for secure auth in production)
- `SAT_FRONTEND_ORIGINS` (comma-separated CORS allowlist)

---

## API surface (frontend-relevant)

- `GET /dashboard` — primary mission snapshot
- `GET /satellites` — fallback satellite feed
- `GET /collisions` — fallback conjunction feed
- `GET /predict` — prediction overlay
- `GET /ml/status` — model/runtime status
- `WS /ws/system-status` — runtime heartbeat

When auth is enforced, protected routes require bearer token access.

---

## Quality gates

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

## Team operating model (how you and your friend should work)

`main` is production and protected. **Never push directly to `main`.**

### Required delivery flow

1. Create a branch from `main`: `feature/<name>` or `fix/<name>`
2. Implement only scoped changes on that branch
3. Open PR to `main`
4. CI must pass:
   - `Frontend lint + build`
   - `Backend tests`
   - `Backend runtime smoke`
5. Wait for required CI checks to pass before merge
6. Merge PR (human or agent) only after all required checks are green. AI agents are authorized to merge autonomously once CI is green.

This is the production-safe workflow used by strong engineering teams (small and large).

### PR review policy (autonomous)

- Use an AI reviewer (Copilot code review / automated review agent) on every PR for fast first-pass feedback.
- Human approval is optional for AI agent PRs if CI passes.
- CI checks are mandatory before merge.
- Branch protection applies to all users, including admins/agents (no bypass merges).

The canonical contributor rules are in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

## CI/CD and live deployment

### GitHub Actions

- CI workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Deploy hook workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-hooks.yml` (skips safely when hook secrets are absent)

### Render Blueprint

`render.yaml` provisions:

- `scp-backend` (FastAPI, health check: `/health`)
- `scp-frontend` (Next.js)

Deploy behavior:

- Auto-deploy on `main` with `checksPass`
- Hobby-compatible configuration (no Preview Environments requirement)

If service names or domains change, update:

- Frontend: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL`
- Backend: `SAT_FRONTEND_ORIGINS`

---

## Reliability posture (current)

- Snapshot path resilience with split-endpoint fallback
- Controlled degradation behavior for optional/auth-limited data
- Guarded timestamp/timeline rendering to avoid runtime crashes
- Stable initial selection behavior after data arrival
- URL normalization safeguards for backend API overrides

---

## Productionization roadmap (recommended next steps)

To make this a true real-world tool, prioritize:

1. **Security hardening**: enforce JWT auth in production, tighten route access, rotate secrets, remove demo defaults.
2. **Data/cache hardening**: move cache path to Redis for multi-instance reliability.
3. **Operational maturity**: add observability (structured logs, latency/error dashboards, alerting).
4. **Scientific accuracy**: expand propagation fidelity and benchmark precision thresholds.
5. **Scale readiness**: support larger catalogs and deterministic compute windows.

## Engineering principle

**No vibe-coding in production paths.**  
Every change should be typed, testable, reviewable, and architecturally justified.
